# Predicting-Avalanches-with-Machine-Learning

Your charity is responsible for avalanche-rescue operations at hiking trails across the northwest of the United States. Granted, the safest option would be to permanently close all trails during skiing and hiking season but that would mean no sportspeople would get to enjoy the great outdoors! Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether an individual day is likely to result in an avalanche. Then by using that prediction, you can close the trail when the risk is high. Keep in mind as you make predictions: Predicting avalanches that don't happen can hurt local tourism while failing to predict avalanches that do happen can result in loss of life. Clearly, a balance must be found.
